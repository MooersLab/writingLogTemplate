## Usage on Overleaf

- Upload the files into your current writing project.
- Open the writing log file to edit it and compile it on the fly.
- Compile times are lightning fast.
- You can configure Overleaf to use its defualt, Vim, or Emacs key bindings.


## Usage in Emacs

Emacs has the `latex-mode` built into the main distribution.
You can install the `AUCTeX` package on top of it.
Compile times are several seconds on a 2018 MacBook Pro with 32 GB of RAM.

- `git clone https://github.com/MooersLab/writingLogTemplate` into the folder containing your current writing project.
- Start Emacs, perhaps using the [latex-emacs](https://github.com/MooersLab/latex-emacs) profile.
- Load the writingLogTemplate.tex file into Emacs via `C-x C-f`. 
- Essential keybindings for editing this file include:
  + `C-g` to abort current command.
  + `C-x C-c` to quit Emacs
  + `C-x C-s` to save the current document.
  + `C-x C-w` to write the current document to a new file name.
  + `C-x u` to undo the last change.
  + `M-UP` or `M-DOWN` to shift lines up and down. UP and Down are the arrow keys.
  + `C-c =` to create a navigable table of contents at the top of the tex file.
  + `C-c C-a` to export to pdflatex, bibtex, make index, and open the resulting PDF in default PDF viewer.

For more keybindings, see the README.md file of the repository for the [latex-emacs](https://github.com/MooersLab/latex-emacs) profile.
