A common problem when working on a paper intermittently is to remember where you stored the data and the code needed for its analysis.
It can be difficult to find these items because they may be stored in folders with names that are not so obvious.
For example a database are set of code may be utilized in two projects but copies may not for both projects.
Ideally, these items are stored in the project folder.

However, these items may have emerged or evolved long before the paper was conceived. 
Moving these items to the current project folder may be awkward.
One does not want to make duplicates needlessly, nor does one want multiple versions to sprout up.
You can make symbolic links from the project folder to the data and code locations. 
But, it would probably be prudent to store in the writing log information about the location of these files as a backup should the symbolic links become accidentally deleted or break.

You can store in the writing log the locations of the data and code so that these items can be found rapidly.
They can be stored in the form of a two column table.
