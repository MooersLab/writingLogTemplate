\section{Update Writing Progress Notebook}
The writing progress notebook enables the tracking of progress on a project basis \footnote{\url{https://github.com/MooersLab/writing-progress-2024-25}}.
The Notebook automatically updates sums of words written and minutes spent across all projects on a given day.
It only takes a few seconds to enter the number of words written and the time spent for a specific project on that project's Google Sheet. 
If you have Voice In plus activated, say the words ``open sheet 37'' to have the worksheet for project 37 opened in the web browser.
If not, click on this direct link to the Google Sheet in the compiled PDF of this writing log \footnote{\url{<insert link for specific sheet>}}.

\section{Update Zettelka\"sten in org-roam}
If you maintain a knowledgebase like a Zettelka\"sten in org-roam or Obsidian or Roam or Notion, you might want to consider making additions a literature notes and permanent notes at the end of a work session.
The name of the index for this project is \verb|XXXXXXXXX|.
Enter \mintinline{emacs}{Control-c n f} to search for this project note.
This knowledge base can be used to store information that you may want to use eventually in the paper.

You could alternatively create a section at the bottom of this writing log for the purpose of storing this kind of information in a list.
Often such listed are very useful for the planning and for the development of the manuscript.
While such notes can be stored in an annotated bibliography (), I seem to be less likely to utilize this information while working on a manuscript because the annotated bibliographies in a different document.
Because it is out of sight, it is also out of mind.

The advantage of keeping these bits of knowledge inside of the writing log is that you can link entries made in the daily log section to these bits of knowledge by using the \label{} and \ref{} macros of LaTeX.
You can also set up label and ref pairs between to-do items and the bits of knowledge
Keeping these items together in one document will improve the odds that you act upon the collected information and it reduces the mental bandwidth that you have to commit to managing this writing log.

Another approach that I use sometimes is to include such information on lines that have been commented out in the manuscriprt's tex document near where I want to use that information.
I do have to admit that this approach can become a little unwieldy it if the comments wind up spanning many lines.
The clutter can be eliminated by using a suction at the bottom of the writing log has discussed above



These notes that you may add might be in the form of what are called \textbf{permanent notes} that include new insights or plans for for the work.
These thoughts are not directly linked or derived from any particular literature reference.
Another kind of note is known as a \textbf{citation note} or \textbf{literature note} and is directly derived from a specific reference.
These kind of notes will contain the BibTeX citekey.

If you are using the Pomodoro method, you would probably want to commit the last one or two poms of a work session on a writing project to the updating of your knowledge base.
If you have been lagging on doing such updates, you may want to commit four to six poms to this kind of work; you might have to do this across multiple days if you have fallen behind.


\section{Timeline or Benchmarks}
This section is an outline of benchmarks or deadlines.
It uses the description environment of latex.
In this environment, the dates are put in square braces.
They will be printed in bold.

It helps to visualize the next steps that need to be taken to move the project forward.
Sometimes you cannot you cannot put forward candidate dates that are close to realistic.
Nonetheless, it is best to try to map out a timeline so that the project can continue to move forward.

\begin{description}
\item [Jan. 21] Move the manuscript into Ms Word.
\item [Jan. 22] Build the tables.
\item [Jan. 23] Run each paragraph through Grammarly.
\item [Jan. 24] Send manuscript to co-author for review.
\item [Jan. 26] Incorporate edits.
\item [Jan. 28] Submit manuscript.

\section{Word Count}
\index{word count}

The word count tends to approach a plateau in the latter stages of writing.

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      xlabel={Date},
      ylabel={Word Count Cumulative},

      % legend entries={},
      ]
      \addplot table [x=Day,y=Words] {wordcount.txt};

  columns/Word/.style={column name=Words},
  ]{wordcount.txt}
  \caption{Date, day and wordcount.}
  \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}

\section{Gathered knowledge and thoughts}

The description environment is a useful one for capturing such bits of information. This information may be in the form of single sentence or any sentences or even several paragraphs.
You can use the text that in the square brackets for the purpose of serving as a title for the idea.

\section{Glossary of jargon}
\index{jargon}

\begin{description}
  \item [censored datacensored data] Censoring hides values from points that are too large, too small, or both. The number of data points that were censored is known, unlike the case for truncated data. Data are right-censored if the value is greater than a threshold. The data are left-censored if the value is below a threshold. The censored data can be treated as missing data. In Stan, the censored data have their own array and their mean and sigma are sampled.
  \item [diminishing adaptation condition] The distance between two consecutive Markov kernels must uniformly decrease to zero.
  \item [leapfrog approximation] The Metropolis-Hastings correction required by the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
  \item [Markov Chain Monte Carlo] A class of algorithms that simulates a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the target distribution of interest. The stationary chain generates a sample from the target distribution.
  \item [No U-turn sampler] An adaptive algorithm that aims to find the best parameter settings by tracking the sample path and preventing HMC from retracing its steps in this path.
  \item [overdispersion] When the observed variance is greater than the mean in count data.
  \item [Poisson overdispersion] The Poisson distribution has a mean that is equal to its variance. When the observed variance is greater than the mean; this is known as overdispersion and indicates that the Poisson model is not appropriate. A common reason for overdispersikon ais the omission of relevant explanatory variables, or dependent observations. Under some circumstances, the problem of overdispersion can be solved by using quasi-likelihood estimation or a negative binomial distribution instead.
